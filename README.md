## Recipe

## Usage

To make your tools unbreakable, follow the recipe above. Next, place the tool you wish to make unbreakable on an anvil
with the `irromolding`. This will make the tool unbreakable if they do not have the mending and unbreakable
enchantments.

## Details

- `Philolite block` and `Luminarchy block` are new minerals that appear in the negative layer between the -4 and -64
  layers in a uniform way.
- `Irromolding` cannot be applied to items that have `mending` and `unbreaking` and an item that is unbreakable cannot
  have these enchantments applied to it.
